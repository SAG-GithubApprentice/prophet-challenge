# Data Preparation and Exploration:
The code begins by installing and importing necessary libraries like Prophet for time series forecasting and pandas for data manipulation. Data from two sources, Google hourly search trends and MercadoLibre stock prices, are loaded into Pandas DataFrames.
The data is explored through visualizations such as line plots to understand trends and distributions. Descriptive statistics like sum, median, and correlation are calculated to gain insights into the data.

# Time Series Analysis:
Time-based trends are analyzed by grouping data by hour, day of the week, and week of the year. This helps identify patterns in search traffic and stock prices over different time intervals. Correlation analysis is conducted to investigate relationships between variables like search traffic, stock volatility, and stock returns. This provides insights into potential dependencies between search activity and market dynamics. Prophet, a forecasting tool, is used to predict future search traffic trends. The model is trained on historical data and used to generate forecasts for future time periods.

# Interpretation and Insights:
The analysis concludes with interpretation and insights derived from the data and visualizations. It addresses specific questions such as the impact of financial results on search traffic, time-based trends in search activity, and correlations between search traffic and stock market variables. The analysis provides actionable insights for stakeholders, such as understanding peak search times, identifying key moments of interest for investors, and forecasting future search traffic trends.
